# Dispute Resolution System Design

## Overview

The Dispute Resolution System is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for handling conflicts that may arise during escrow transactions. The system allows buyers and sellers to submit evidence, communicate through a structured messaging system, propose and accept resolutions, and, when necessary, escalate disputes for administrative review.

## System Components

### Entities

1. **Dispute**

   - Core entity representing a dispute between buyer and seller
   - Tracks dispute status, resolution type, and timeline
   - Links to the associated escrow transaction
   - Status progression: EVIDENCE_SUBMISSION → UNDER_REVIEW → RESOLVED states

2. **DisputeEvidence**

   - Represents evidence submitted by either party
   - Supports multiple evidence types: text, images, documents, videos
   - Links evidence to specific disputes and users

3. **DisputeMessage**
   - Provides a communication channel for dispute participants
   - Supports both user messages and system notifications
   - Maintains a chronological record of all dispute communications

### Services

1. **DisputeService**

   - Core business logic for dispute management
   - Handling dispute creation, evidence submission, and resolution
   - Enforcing business rules and authorization

2. **DisputeSchedulerService**
   - Automated processing of time-sensitive dispute operations
   - Handles expiration of evidence submission deadlines
   - Identifies stale disputes for escalation

### Controllers and APIs

1. **DisputeController**
   - RESTful API endpoints for dispute operations
   - Secured with JWT authentication
   - Validated input with DTOs

## Workflow

### Dispute Creation

1. Either the buyer or seller of an escrow transaction can initiate a dispute
2. The escrow status is updated to "DISPUTED" to prevent further actions
3. The dispute is created with initial status "EVIDENCE_SUBMISSION"
4. An evidence submission deadline is set (5 days from creation)
5. A system message is recorded documenting the dispute creation

### Evidence Submission Phase

1. Both parties can submit evidence supporting their claims
2. Each evidence submission is recorded and linked to the submitting user
3. System messages track all evidence submissions
4. Evidence can only be submitted until the submission deadline

### Resolution Proposal

1. Either party can propose a resolution:

   - BUYER_REFUND: Refund to buyer
   - SELLER_RECEIVE: Funds released to seller
   - SPLIT: Split funds according to specified percentages
   - CUSTOM: Custom arrangement

2. The proposed resolution is recorded as a system message
3. The other party can accept the proposed resolution
4. When accepted, the dispute status changes to "MUTUALLY_RESOLVED"

### Administrative Resolution

1. If parties cannot reach a mutual resolution, dispute enters "UNDER_REVIEW"
2. Administrators can review all evidence and messages
3. Admin can make a binding resolution decision
4. System records the admin's decision and rationale
5. Dispute status changes to "RESOLVED_BY_ADMIN"

### Automated Processing

1. DisputeSchedulerService automatically processes disputes with expired evidence deadlines
2. Identifies disputes that have been under review too long
3. Can escalate or apply automated resolutions based on business rules

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**

   - Only dispute participants can view and interact with their disputes
   - Only admins can access administrative resolution functions
   - All operations enforce strict permission checks

2. **Data Integrity**

   - All dispute operations use database transactions
   - System maintains comprehensive audit trail via system messages
   - Timestamps track all key events in dispute lifecycle

3. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs validated through DTOs
   - Business rule enforcement in service layer
   - Proper error handling with descriptive messages

## User Experience

1. **Transparency**

   - Clear status indicators for dispute progress
   - Chronological message history with timestamps
   - System messages document all significant events

2. **Communication**

   - Structured messaging system for direct communication
   - Ability to reference specific evidence in messages
   - Support for attaching files to evidence

3. **Fairness**
   - Equal submission rights for both parties
   - Multiple resolution options to fit different scenarios
   - Escalation path when mutual resolution isn't possible

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification System**

   - Email/push notifications for dispute events
   - Reminders before evidence deadline expires
   - Alerts for new messages or evidence

2. **Dispute Templates**

   - Pre-defined dispute reason templates
   - Guided evidence submission process
   - Resolution recommendation engine

3. **Expanded Resolution Options**
   - Time-based partial releases
   - Conditional resolutions
   - Third-party mediation integration

## Implementation Phases

The Dispute Resolution System is being implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core Escrow System

   - Secure escrow agreements
   - Milestone tracking
   - Basic release mechanisms

2. **Phase 2 (Current)**: Dispute Resolution

   - Evidence submission
   - Messaging system
   - Resolution mechanisms
   - Admin tools

3. **Phase 3 (Planned)**: Advanced Features
   - Notification system
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Enhanced admin dashboard
   - Dispute prevention tools
