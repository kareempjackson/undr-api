# Escrow System Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the GhostPay escrow system. The testing approach ensures that all escrow functionality is thoroughly validated across multiple layers of the application.

## Test Layers

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual service methods and components in isolation.

- **Coverage**:

  - `EscrowService` methods
  - `EscrowSchedulerService` methods
  - Validation logic
  - Helper functions

- **Mocking Strategy**:

  - Database repositories are mocked to isolate service logic
  - External dependencies (payment gateways, notifications) are mocked
  - Authentication and authorization contexts are simulated

- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Escrow creation with valid/invalid inputs
  - Escrow funding with sufficient/insufficient funds
  - Proof submission and validation
  - Status transitions (PENDING → FUNDED → COMPLETED)
  - Error handling and validation

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components.

- **Coverage**:

  - API controller integrations with services
  - Service integrations with repositories
  - Database operations
  - Transaction handling

- **Test Database**:

  - Uses a dedicated test database
  - Runs migrations before tests
  - Cleans up test data after test runs

- **Key Test Cases**:
  - End-to-end API flows with mock repositories
  - Database transaction integrity
  - Error propagation between layers

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests validate complete user journeys through the system, simulating real user interactions.

- **Coverage**:

  - Complete escrow lifecycle
  - API endpoints
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Database persistence

- **Test Fixtures**:

  - Creates test users (buyers and sellers)
  - Sets up test wallets with funds
  - Generates JWT tokens for authentication
  - Cleans up all test data

- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Full escrow flow: creation → funding → proof submission → approval → completion
  - Scheduled automatic releases
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Authentication and authorization enforcement

### 4. Scheduled Task Tests

Specific tests for time-based operations and background tasks.

- **Coverage**:

  - Automatic escrow release functionality
  - Scheduled processing of pending escrows

- **Testing Approach**:
  - Mocks the scheduler trigger
  - Uses manipulated timestamps to simulate future dates
  - Verifies correct processing of scheduled items

## Resilience and Error Handling in Tests

All tests are designed to be resilient to environmental differences:

- **Database Schema Awareness**:

  - Tests check for existence of tables and columns before execution
  - Skips tests that depend on schema features not yet available
  - Gracefully handles schema differences between environments

- **Feature Detection**:

  - Checks for the existence of methods and features before testing them
  - Provides informative logs when skipping tests due to missing features
  - Allows tests to run in partial implementation environments

- **Error Handling**:
  - Logs detailed information about test failures
  - Captures and reports API responses for debugging
  - Continues testing subsequent features even if earlier tests fail

## Test Data Management

- **Isolation**:

  - Each test run uses unique data identifiers (UUID-based IDs, unique email addresses)
  - Tests clean up their own data before and after execution
  - Uses database transactions to isolate test cases where possible

- **Cleanup Strategy**:
  - Proper order of deletion to respect foreign key constraints
  - Fallback to direct SQL queries when ORM operations fail
  - Guaranteed cleanup with try/catch blocks

## Future Test Expansions

As we progress to Phase 2 (Dispute Resolution System), test coverage will expand to include:

1. **Dispute Creation and Resolution Tests**:

   - Testing the creation of disputes on escrows
   - Validating the dispute resolution workflow
   - Verifying proper state transitions

2. **Admin Panel Tests**:

   - Tests for administrative dispute resolution
   - Moderation actions and their effects
   - Validation of admin-specific permissions

3. **Notification Tests**:

   - Tests for dispute-related notifications
   - Event triggers for status changes
   - Email/notification delivery verification

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Load testing for dispute resolution scenarios
   - Verification of system performance under heavy dispute loads
   - Testing of concurrent dispute resolution cases

## Test Execution

- **CI/CD Integration**:

  - Tests run automatically on pull requests
  - Dedicated test environment for CI/CD pipeline
  - Test results reported as PR checks

- **Local Development**:
  - Developers can run specific test suites with `npm test -- --testPathPattern=escrow`
  - E2E tests can be run with `npm test src/modules/security/escrow.e2e.spec.ts`
  - Mock services for quick testing without external dependencies

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures the escrow system's reliability, security, and correctness through comprehensive test coverage at multiple levels. The approach balances thoroughness with practicality, allowing tests to run in various environments and adapt to the evolving implementation of the escrow system.
